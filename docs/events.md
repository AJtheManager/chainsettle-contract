# ChainSettle Events

Every event the `ChainSettleContract` publishes with `env.events().publish`,
audited against [`contracts/chainsetttle/src/lib.rs`](../contracts/chainsetttle/src/lib.rs),
the source of truth. Function names below are the exact Rust function names.

The contract emits two families of events:

1. **Canonical lifecycle events**: seven indexer-friendly events with a
   two-topic form and a self-describing `Map` payload. See
   [Canonical lifecycle events](#canonical-lifecycle-events).
2. **Granular events**: one or more per state-changing function, with the
   event name as the first topic and a positional tuple (or single value) as
   data. See [Event reference](#event-reference).

Some names appear in both families (`shipment_created`, `proof_submitted`,
`milestone_confirmed`, `dispute_resolved`, `shipment_cancelled`). Tell them
apart by the first topic: canonical events always start with
`Symbol("chainsettle")`.

`test_every_published_topic_is_documented` in
[`test_events_doc.rs`](../contracts/chainsetttle/src/test_events_doc.rs)
fails if a literal topic passed to `publish` is missing from this file.

## Conventions

- **Topics.** Granular events use `(Symbol(<name>), <key>...)`. The key is
  usually `shipment_id` (`String`). Admin-wide settings often have no key.
- **Data.** Shown as the Rust expression the contract publishes, so field
  names match the local variables in `lib.rs`. `.clone()`/`.unwrap()` calls
  are omitted. `()` means an empty payload.
- **Placeholders used in the tables:**

| Placeholder | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ledger_seq` | `u32` | `env.ledger().sequence()` at emission |
| `primary_buyer` | `Address` | `shipment.buyers.get(0)`, the first buyer |
| `<name>_len` | `u32` | Length of the named `Vec`/`Map` (`x.len()`) |
| `shipment_id`, `proof_hash`, `note` | `String` | |
| `milestone_index`, `idx`, `*_ledgers`, `*_ledger`, `*_bps`, `approvals_count` | `u32` | |
| `amount`, `payment`, `*_amount`, `fee_amount`, `refund`, `cap`, `limit` | `i128` | In the escrow token's smallest unit |
| `proposal_id` | `u64` | Upgrade, freeze, unfreeze and fee-waiver proposals |
| `buyer`, `supplier`, `arbiter`, `admin`, `caller`, `token` | `Address` | |

## Canonical lifecycle events

```
topics: (Symbol("chainsettle"), Symbol(<event_name>))
data:   Map<Symbol, Val>
```

The payload is a `Map<Symbol, Val>` keyed by the field names below, so new
optional fields can be added without breaking positional decoders. They are
published by private `emit_*` helpers. The "Emitted by" lists give the public
functions that reach them.

### `shipment_created`

Published by `emit_shipment_created`. Emitted by `create_shipment`, after the
shipment is persisted and escrow is funded.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The new shipment's identifier. |
| `buyer` | `Address` | The primary (first) buyer. |
| `supplier` | `Address` | The supplier. |
| `arbiter` | `Address` | The assigned arbiter (or the pool sentinel arbiter). |
| `token` | `Address` | The SAC token address used for escrow. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Total shipment value locked in escrow. |

### `proof_submitted`

Published by `emit_milestone_proof_submitted`. Emitted by `submit_proof` (on
every submission and resubmission) and by `attest_proof` (when dual
attestation completes).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `milestone_index` | `u32` | Milestone the proof is for. |
| `proof_hash` | `String` | The submitted proof hash or off-chain reference. |
| `supplier` | `Address` | The shipment's supplier (`Shipment.supplier`), not necessarily the caller. Consortium members and substitutes appear in the granular `proof_submitted` event's `caller` field. |

### `milestone_confirmed`

Published by `emit_milestone_confirmed`. Emitted whenever a milestone payment is
released through the confirmation path: `confirm_milestone`,
`release_held_payment` (once the holdback window expires),
`batch_confirm_milestones` (once per milestone) and `claim_auto_confirmation`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `milestone_index` | `u32` | Index of the confirmed milestone. |
| `payout_amount` | `i128` | Gross milestone payment, before fee, logistics and penalty deductions. |

### `dispute_opened`

Published by `emit_dispute_opened`. Emitted by `raise_dispute`,
`raise_partial_dispute`, and `report_condition_breach` (when the oracle breach
threshold opens a dispute).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `milestone_index` | `u32` | Index of the disputed milestone. |
| `buyer` | `Address` | The buyer who raised the dispute (primary buyer for oracle-opened disputes). |

### `dispute_resolved`

Published by `emit_dispute_resolved`. Emitted by `resolve_dispute`,
`finalize_dispute_resolution`, `resolve_dispute_timeout`, `accept_mediation`
and `cast_dispute_vote` (when a panel reaches a decision).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `milestone_index` | `u32` | Index of the resolved milestone. |
| `resolution` | `Symbol` | `"supplier"` if the disputed funds went to the supplier, `"buyer"` if refunded or withheld. |
| `resolver` | `Address` | The resolving arbiter. For timeout resolution this is the shipment's arbiter. |
| `reason` | `ResolutionReason` | **Added.** One of `ProofValid`, `ProofInvalid`, `ProofLate`, `InsufficientEvidence`, `MutualSettlement`. When no reason is given it defaults to `ProofValid` for a `"supplier"` resolution and `ProofInvalid` otherwise. |

### `shipment_cancelled`

Published by `emit_shipment_cancelled`. Emitted by `cancel_shipment`,
`batch_cancel_shipments`, `supplier_cancel`, `claim_deadline_refund`,
`sweep_unclaimed_refund`, `cancel_for_blacklisted_supplier`, and the emergency
recovery path (`emergency_recover`, `propose_emergency_recover`,
`execute_emergency_recover`).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `refund_amount` | `i128` | Amount refunded: the unconfirmed escrow balance, net of any cancellation fee. Funds already released for confirmed milestones are never included. For `AdminEmergencyRecovery` it is the amount recovered to the admin. |
| `reason` | `Symbol` | `"BuyerCancelled"`, `"SupplierCancelled"`, `"DeadlineRefund"`, `"AdminEmergencyRecovery"` or `"BlacklistedSupplier"`. Additive third field. The typed `CancellationReason` is also stored on `Shipment.cancellation_reason`. |

### `shipment_completed`

Published by `emit_shipment_completed` from `settle_on_completion`. Emitted when
the last milestone settles and the shipment becomes `Completed`: from
`confirm_milestone`, `release_held_payment`, `batch_confirm_milestones`,
`claim_auto_confirmation`, `resolve_dispute`, `finalize_dispute_resolution`,
`resolve_dispute_timeout`, `accept_mediation` and `cast_dispute_vote`.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shipment_id` | `String` | The shipment identifier. |
| `total_paid` | `i128` | Total released to the supplier (`Shipment.released_amount` at completion). |

## Changed and inconsistent payloads

Changes found in this audit. Indexers decoding positional tuples should check
these first.

| Event | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `chainsettle` / `dispute_resolved` | **Changed** (additive) | New `reason` field (`ResolutionReason`). Not in earlier versions of this doc. |
| `chainsettle` / `shipment_cancelled` | **Changed** (additive) | `reason` can now be `"BlacklistedSupplier"` (from `cancel_for_blacklisted_supplier`). |
| `milestone_confirmed` (granular) | **Changed** (additive) | `confirm_milestone` appends `applied_fee_bps` as a 9th field (#399). Decoders reading the first 8 fields still work. |
| `milestone_confirmed` (granular) | **Shape differs by emitter** | `batch_confirm_milestones` publishes 7 fields with no `penalty_deducted` or `applied_fee_bps`, so field 4 is `supplier` rather than `penalty_deducted`. Decode by tuple length. |
| `dispute_resolved` (granular) | **Shape differs by emitter** | `resolve_dispute` publishes 6 fields, ending with `reason`. Panel decisions (`cast_dispute_vote`) publish 5, without `reason`. |
| `proof_submitted` (granular) | **Shape differs by emitter** | `submit_proof` sends `(milestone_index, proof_hash, proof_type, caller, current_ledger)`. `attest_proof` sends the first attester in the `caller` position. |
| `proof_resubmitted` | Split from `proof_submitted` | `submit_proof` publishes `proof_resubmitted` instead of `proof_submitted` when the milestone already had a proof. Same payload. |
| `shipment_cancelled` (granular) | **Shape differs by emitter** | `cancel_shipment_internal` publishes `(refund, cancel_fee, buyer, ledger_seq)`. `cancel_for_blacklisted_supplier` publishes `(unreleased, 0, buyer, ledger_seq)`. |
| `grade_settled` | **Meaning differs by emitter** | Same 5-field shape. From `release_held_payment` the 4th and 5th fields are `(payment, grade_refund)`. From `resolve_dispute` they are `(payment - contested, buyer_refund)`. |
| `emergency_freeze_activated`, `emergency_freeze_lifted` | **Shape differs by emitter** | Single-admin path (`propose_emergency_freeze` / `propose_emergency_unfreeze` with threshold 1) sends `(admin, ledger_seq)`. Multisig execution sends `proposal_id` (`u64`). |
| `dispute_raised` | Additional emitter | Also published when an oracle breach opens a dispute (`report_condition_breach`). |
| `arbiter_pool_updated` | Note | First data element is the symbol `"added"` or `"removed"`. |
| `shipment_fee_override_cleared` | **Inconsistent** with `_set` | `shipment_id` is in data, not topics. |
| `token_min_shipment_value_cleared`, `token_max_shipment_value_cleared` | **Inconsistent** with `_set` | `token` is in data, not topics. |
| `contract_upgraded` / `upgrade_executed` | Two paths | `upgrade` emits `contract_upgraded`. Multisig upgrades emit `upgrade_executed`. |
| `max_expiry_ext_set` | Note | Abbreviated name for `set_max_expiry_extension_ledgers` (32-character symbol limit). |

No event has been removed. None is formally deprecated: the shape differences
above are kept for backward compatibility.
